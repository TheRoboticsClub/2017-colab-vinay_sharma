# dl-objectdetector
## Note
This is an early release, so it is based on an already downloaded model from TensorFlow, which is working over a SSD detector trained on the COCO (Common Objects in COntext), on 17th November, 2017. In a future release, you will be able to select the desired model, and download it in execution time.
## Requirements
* JdeRobot ([installation guide](http://jderobot.org/Installation)).
* TensorFlow (```sudo pip install tensorflow```).
* [Protobuf installation](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection) (read below).

More dependencies might be installed automatically with the packages mentioned above.

## Basement
This component works over a library of TensorFlow pre-trained models, importing one of them and embedding it on the component developed [here](https://github.com/RoboticsURJC-students/2017-tfg-nacho_condes). Hence, to be able to run it, we have to install previously the ```protobufs``` provided with the models, following the installation guide.

## Behavioral
For the moment, this node handles a real-time stream of video (incoming by an ICE/ROS proxy, automatically processed by the `comm` library), and shows a window displaying it, and also the output from the detection network. It provides a button for toggling on/off the real-time detection (TODO: implement another button to process a single frame on demand)

## How to Use
Open Terminal and type ```cameraserver cameraserver.cfg```
In another terminal type ```python objectdetector.py objectdetector.yml```
Although, you might have to edit the Model node in yml configuration file to suit your needs.
For training custom models one would need a tar.gz file same as the model name containing checkpoint information and a frozen inference graph generated by Tensorflow. Extract the file in the Net folder.
Path to labels is also necessary to label bounding boxes, contained in a .pbtxt file.

Some sample models are available to use right away [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/477ed41e7e4e8a8443bc633846eb01e2182dc68a/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md)
